# Oneliner

A rather simple `sed` script to make a block of text with linebreaks and hyphenated words be on a single line. I mainly use this when copying text to quote from PDFs.

## What it does not handle

- Empty lines (could easily be fixed should the need arise for me)
- Hyphenated words on a line break that should actually stay hyphenated, even when only on one line
